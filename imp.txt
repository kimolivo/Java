================================
EULA contents In the majority of cases, we would expect this EULA template to be used in such a way that the end user gives his or her agreement to the template upon download or installation. However, the template also includes more traditional "shrink-wrap" acceptance provisions.

The suggested licence covers the installation of the software, the use of the software in accordance with its documentation, and the creation of back-up copies of the software. However, you should adapt this to suit your own situation. Sub-licensing may either be expressly permitted or prohibited.

The EULA incorporates optional provisions regarding licensing charges and their payment.

A standard set of software warranties (and warranty exceptions) is also included.

Although this template EULA references consumer rights, it does not include any provisions designed to help you comply with EU distance selling laws. If you are looking for a document that will help with such compliance, see: software download terms and conditions.
